"""Project-sample collection for the calibration corpus.

For each project in :data:`PROJECT_SAMPLES`, the collector:

  1. Shallow-clones the project to a transient temp dir.
  2. Runs ``run_sca`` against it (offline-OSV, cache-friendly).
  3. Writes the findings to
     ``packages/sca/data/calibration/project_samples/<ecosystem>/
     <name>.json``.
  4. **Discards the source.** We never store the cloned tree —
     only OUR scan output, which is RAPTOR-generated and ships
     under MIT.

The output schema strips file paths under the project root; only
the dep + finding metadata that the corpus needs for validation
(``raptor_risk_estimate``, ``severity``, ``in_kev``, ``epss``,
``cve_id``) is preserved. Project source code is NEVER included.

License compliance:

  * We don't redistribute the cloned project — it's transient.
  * Our scan output is RAPTOR-generated (MIT). Each output JSON
    carries a ``_source.license: "MIT (RAPTOR-generated)"`` block.
  * The license-compliance check (:mod:`._license_check`) treats
    files under ``project_samples/`` permissively (filename refs
    not required in ATTRIBUTION.md per-file; the parent dir's
    citation suffices).

The project list is intentionally small for the bootstrap — top-N
per ecosystem can come later via the ``popular/<eco>.json``
auto-derived list. Curated start lets us control which licenses
we touch (only OSI-approved permissive). Each entry pins the
clone target so re-runs are reproducible.
